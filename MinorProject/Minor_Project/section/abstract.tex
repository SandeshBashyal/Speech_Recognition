Home automation using speech recognition is a project carried out with intention to explore the concept of home automation through integration of technology. It is a hardware and software-based project which focuses on economic implementation of home automation. The goal of this project is to explore various technological aspects involved in  achieving automation of tasks to improve the overall convenience. To achieve this goal, real-time audio data from the microphone is transmitted to raspberry pi. The data is then processed by the speech recognition model in raspberry pi which generates text as an output. This text obtained is compared with predefined keywords and incase of a match, the text is converted to signals which is then transferred to appliance(s) through the relay module. The status of appliances are then updated in real-time and shown through a web application.
