\chapter{LITERATURE REVIEW}
Colorization of gray-scale images has become a prominent application of Convolutional Neural Network. With many research works and projects evolving around this domain, various implementations of the CNN architectures have been proposed for the purpose. Typically, optimization methods that optimize each pixel based on user inputs or reference images are used for colorization \cite{Nepalipaper}.
